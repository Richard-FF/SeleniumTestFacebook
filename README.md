A sample to test Facebook login/logout with Selenium, TestNG, Allure, Page object, PageFactory, Gson etc.

1. My test enviroments: Windows7(64-bit), Chrome, Eclipse(Oxygen), Maven etc.
2. Download project and import this existing Maven project with IDE.
3. Modify your facebook username and password in "testdata.json" file which located in "testdata" folder of your project root directory like following:
	"loginpage": {
  		"user": "123456@gmail.com",		
  		"password": "12345678"
  	},
4. Run "pom.xml" as "Maven test" or run "testng.xml" as "TestNG test".
5. After install allure on your machine and config system PATH, execute "allure serve yourprojectdirectory/allure-results" to check test report generated by allure.
